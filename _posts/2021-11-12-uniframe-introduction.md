## What is fuzzy string matching and why it is useful
Fuzzy string matching is literally matching a string against a list of strings, and finding the most similar one(s). A string matching is basically comparing strings pair-wisely, computing the similarity scores and picking up the most similar string(s). This animation illustrates how string matching can help to link entities.

Basically, when there is no unique key for exact match, fuzzy string matching becomes very useful. Here are some examples in different industry:
- **Cyber-security department in banking**: banks are obliged to monitor the names on all transactions to see if these match with international watch lists. String matching can be used to analysed the transaction name and link the party in a transaction with the international watch lists
- **Supply chain department in Fast-moving consumer goods industry**: match external dataset with internal customer data
- **Data management department in the Geo Information industry**: addresses of point of interest have different ways of representation in different data sources. String matching can help data aggregation.
