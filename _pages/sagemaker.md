## What is Amazon SageMaker
The best decription of Amazon SageMaker is from its [document](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/){:target="_blank"}: 
>Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models. <br /> <br />Traditional ML development is a complex, expensive, iterative process made even harder because there are no integrated tools for the entire machine learning workflow. You need to stitch together tools and workflows, which is time-consuming and error-prone. SageMaker solves this challenge by providing all of the components used for machine learning in a single toolset so models get to production faster with much less effort and at lower cost.

## Who Needs This Training
- Someone who wants to use or promote Amazon SageMaker and AWS AI/ML solution in your organization
- It's ideal (but not required) for participants to have a data science or analytics background.
- Participants needs to know some basic AWS knowledge such as S3, EC2, IAM, etc

## What This Training Is
- It will provide you with hands-on experience to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly
- It will provide you with end to end understanding of building ML use cases from feature engineering to understanding various in-built algorithm and Train , Tune and Deploy the ML model in production like scenario
- It guides you to bring your own model and perform on-premise ML workload Lift-and-Shift to Amazon SageMaker platform.
- It further demonstrate advance concept like Model Debugging , Model Monitoring and AutoML and guide to evaluate your machine leaning workload through AWS ML Well-architect lens.
- This training will empower you as an AWS champion, and you can bring the value of AWS back to your organization, even if you are not yet experts in AWS.

## What This Trianing Is Not
- This training will not bring you to a professional level immediately. The best way to achieve it is learning by doing - applying what you learn from this training on your daily work and keep on practicing.
- This training is not a substitute for preparing [AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certification exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/){:target="_abount"}. You can follow the [AWS Training and Certification page](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/machine-learning/){:target="_blank"} to prepare the exam.
- This training is not dedicated to machine learning business use case discovery in your organization. Welcome to talk to me to see how to empower your business by using data science.
- This training will not cover the topics of machine learning Ops and how to run a ML model in a production environment. If you are interested in these topics, please check our **[ML Ops on AWS Workshop](/workshops/mlops/)**.

## Preparation

### Call
- Align the expectation of the training
- Communicate training day, number of participants, preparation, venue, etc

### Setup Account
- You should use a AWS account that is not running production systems.
- Any accounts should be created a minimum of three days ahead of time. It takes time for new accounts to be completely ready, payment methods to be confirmed, and limits to be set.
- If you will share an account between multiple people:
  - Ensure they create IAM accounts for each user that will take labs.
  - Adjust account limits to support the number of students doing labs. Note this process can take up to a week, depending on the specific limits.
  - Check limits for EC2 instances, VPCs (# of VPCs, # of IGWs, # of security groups, EIPs), ELBs, etc. The limits that need to be adjusted depends on the labs that will be delivered.
  - More information about limits can be found on the [AWS Service Limits page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home){:target="_blank"}.

### Software
- Use up to date software: Ensure students are using a recent version of Edge, Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
- Students using Windows laptops should have a SSH client (like PuTTY) installed.

## After Training
- Post-event clean-up: If you were using your own AWS accounts, remind them that resources left running in their own AWS accounts will result in a bill. Help them clean up any resources still running.
- Ensure that participants not only terminate Sagemaker Notebook instance but also stop any SageMaker deployment endpoint.
- Let us know your feedback! We are always looking for ways to improve our content for this training.

<!-- ## SageMaker in General
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that allows developers and data scientists can use to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. There are a lot of components to SageMaker, whether you’re using the manged development environments, the ephemeral training clusters, the hyperparamter tuning, or the deployed endpoint

Amazon SageMaker is a **fully managed machine learning service**. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides an integrated **Jupyter authoring notebook** instance for easy access to your data sources for exploration and analysis, so you don't have to manage servers. It also provides common machine learning algorithms that are optimized to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With native support for **bring-your-own-algorithms and frameworks**, SageMaker offers flexible distributed training options that adjust to your specific workflows. **Deploy a model into a secure and scalable environment** by launching it with a few clicks from SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker console. Training and hosting are billed by minutes of usage, with no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.

SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models. It is specifically designed to help us accelerate a customer opportunity for Machine-learning workload in AWS.
Amazon SageMaker Immersion Days leverage a modular content format, allowing you to select from ready-made presentations and labs and adapt your curriculum to your customer’s needs.

This training is not a substitute for AWS Training and Certification. If you needs in-depth training, reach out to the T&C team at AWS Training or engage your local Training BDM. The Training BD team can help organize training courses, from introductory to advanced level.
Amazon SageMaker Immersion Days are typically not used for demand generation or prospecting activities. If there isn’t an existing Opportunity in SFDC, you should ask whether an Immersion Day is the right solution.

Post-event clean-up: If the customer was using their own AWS accounts, contact them 2-3 days after the Immersion day and remind them that resources left running in their own AWS accounts will result in a bill.
